The lemon acidity was bright but not overwhelming, creating a beautifully balanced cup. I used a medium-fine grind at 200°F with a 1:16.7 ratio and the extraction was perfect. The tea-like body was silky smooth. This is hands down one of the best light roasts I have ever tasted. Will definitely be ordering more.",
