  That's not an e-commerce app. That's a platform for coffee nerds.

  What You Actually Have

  You've been building the storefront piece of something bigger:

  The Omni-Roast Ecosystem (your true north)
  │
  ├── 🏪 Storefront (Artisan Roast) ← You're here
  │   └── Sell beans, subscriptions, merch
  │
  ├── 🔥 Roast Profile API ← The magic
  │   ├── Upload profiles from hardware
  │   ├── Community ratings & feedback
  │   └── "Clone this profile" to your roaster
  │
  ├── 🤖 Hardware Integration ← The moat
  │   ├── Partner with home roaster manufacturers
  │   └── "Works with Omni-Roast" certification
  │
  └── 👥 Community ← The flywheel
      ├── Share profiles
      ├── Rate others' roasts
      └── Follow roasters you love

  The e-commerce piece is table stakes. The roast profile sharing is the differentiator.

  ---
  Why This Changes Everything

  Generic "Shopify for coffee" = Compete on features (hard, boring)

  Roast profile ecosystem = Create a new category (exciting, defensible)

  The home roasting market is growing. Machines like:
  - Aillio Bullet R1
  - Kaldi Home Roaster
  - Fresh Roast SR800
  - Behmor 2000AB Plus

  None of them have a community platform for sharing profiles.

  Minimum Viable Magic

  Instead of building provisioning infrastructure, what if you built the one thing nobody else has?

  The Roast Profile MVP

  roastprofiles.app (or omni-roast.dev)
  │
  ├── Browse Profiles
  │   ├── Ethiopian Yirgacheffe - Light Roast
  │   │   ├── ⭐ 4.8 (234 roasts)
  │   │   ├── Charge: 200°C, Drop: 215°C, Time: 11:30
  │   │   └── [Clone to My Roaster] [Buy These Beans]
  │   │
  │   └── Colombian Huila - Medium
  │       ├── ⭐ 4.6 (189 roasts)
  │       └── ...
  │
  ├── Upload Your Profile
  │   ├── Manual entry
  │   └── Import from Artisan (roasting software)
  │
  └── Link to Buy Beans
      └── → Artisan Roast store (your e-comm app)

  This is your wedge. Not "another store builder."

  The Path That Honors All Three Goals
  ┌───────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │       Goal        │                    How This Serves It                     │
  ├───────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Build a business  │ Roast profiles → drives bean sales → subscription revenue │
  ├───────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Build reputation  │ "The person who built the GitHub for roast profiles"      │
  ├───────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Scratch your itch │ You get to nerd out on coffee AND code                    │

  What I'd Do If I Were You

  Phase 1: Plant the Flag (This Month)

  - Rename/rebrand - "Omni-Roast" or similar (bigger than one store)
  - Add roast profile schema to your app
  - Build a simple profile browser (public page, no auth needed)
  - Seed with 10-20 real profiles you've tried yourself
  - Post in r/roasting, r/coffee, home-roasters.com forums

  Phase 2: Validate the Nerd Market (Next Month)

  - Can you get 100 profiles uploaded? (even manually)
  - Do people actually browse them?
  - Does anyone click "buy these beans"?

  Phase 3: Hardware Integration (When Validated)

  - Artisan Roasting Software - open source, has export format
  - Cropster - commercial but has API
  - Build simple import - "Upload your Artisan log"

  The Smile Test

  You said the roaster vision "puts a smile on your face."

  Building provisioning infrastructure? Probably not smiling.

  Building a roast profile community? That's the thing.

  Build the thing that makes you smile. The rest is just infrastructure to support it.

  ---
  One More Thought

  The e-commerce app you've built is really good. It doesn't need more features. It needs:

  1. A reason to exist that isn't "Shopify but open source"
  2. A community that cares about it
  3. A wedge into a specific market

  The roast profile idea IS that wedge.

  What if the README said:

  Omni-Roast: The open-source platform for coffee roasters

  - 🔥 Share and discover roast profiles
  - 🛒 Sell your beans online (Stripe, subscriptions)
  - 🤖 AI-powered recommendations
  - ☕ Built by a coffee nerd, for coffee nerds

  That's a story people share.

  What do you think? Does leaning into the roaster angle feel right, or does it feel like scope creep from the e-commerce launch?
