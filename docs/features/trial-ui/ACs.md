# Hosted Store — Trial UI · ACs

**Branch:** `feat/hosted-store-s2`
**Plan:** [`plan.md`](plan.md)
**Iterations:** 0 (initial)

---

## Doc stance

This is the public open-source ACs doc — verification accountability for the UI states the store renders. **No data shapes**, no DB schemas, no platform internals. Where the platform owns shape (e.g. trial-status response, license fields, cancel-reason DB), the AC verifies behavior at the store boundary (does the card render correctly given the platform's response?), not the platform's internal data.

## Column Definitions

| Column | Filled by | When |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **Agent** | Verification sub-agent | During `/ac-verify` — PASS/FAIL with brief evidence |
| **QC** | Main thread agent | After reading sub-agent report — confirms or overrides |
| **Reviewer** | Human (reviewer) | During manual review — final approval per AC |

Screenshots saved to `.screenshots/hosted-store-trial-ui/` (gitignored).

## Test fixture setups

UI ACs use one of six fixture lifecycle states. Each runs against a mock platform on `localhost:3001` returning the trial-status JSON shape (shape owned by platform — see `artisan-roast-platform/docs/products/hosted/features/extended-trial-lifecycle/` for the endpoint contract).

**Setup A — Self-hosted (Community current):** no `HOSTED_TRIAL_ID`, no Priority Support active.

**Setup B — Self-hosted (Priority Support active):** no `HOSTED_TRIAL_ID`, Priority Support license active.

**Setup C — Trial · active · no-card:**

```bash
HOSTED_TRIAL_ID=test-trial-active
PLATFORM_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
PLATFORM_EXTEND_URL=https://buy.stripe.com/test_extend_link
PLATFORM_SUBSCRIBE_URL=https://buy.stripe.com/test_subscribe_link
LICENSE_KEY=test-license-key
```

Mock returns trial-status with `status: ACTIVE`, `cardAdded: false`, days remaining out of 14.

**Setup D — Trial · active · card-added:** same env. Mock returns `cardAdded: true`, days remaining out of 30.

**Setup E — Trial · expired (grace period):** same env. Mock returns `status: EXPIRED`, `cardAdded: false`, days remaining at 0, deprovisioning date in the future.

**Setup F — Hosted Paid · converted from trial:** same env. Mock returns `status: CONVERTED` with subscription / renewal info.

**Setup G — Hosted Paid · direct-subscribe:** `HOSTED_TRIAL_ID` unset (no trial record); `LICENSE_KEY` set with HOSTED tier license. Mock returns license with `tier: HOSTED` and Priority Tickets pool populated.

## Functional Acceptance Criteria

| AC | What | How | Pass | Agent | QC | Reviewer |
|----|------|-----|------|-------|----|----------|
| AC-FN-1 | `IS_HOSTED` evaluates from `HOSTED_TRIAL_ID` env | Code review: `lib/hosted.ts` | Constant truthy when env set, falsy otherwise; mirrors `IS_DEMO` shape | | | |
| AC-FN-2 | `getTrialStatus()` calls platform with revalidate | Code review: `lib/hosted.ts` | Server-side fetch to `${PLATFORM_API_URL}/api/trial/hosted/${HOSTED_TRIAL_ID}/status` with `next: { revalidate: 60 }`; returns null on error (does not throw) | | | |
| AC-FN-3 | Plans catalog filters by visibility discriminator | Code review: `lib/plans.ts` + `PlanPageClient.tsx` | Each MOCK_PLAN entry has `visibility: "self-hosted" \| "hosted"`; PlanPageClient filters by `IS_HOSTED` before rendering | | | |
| AC-FN-4 | Trial card visibility rule | Code review: `PlanPageClient.tsx` | Trial card render is conditional on `trialStatus?.status === "ACTIVE" \|\| "EXPIRED"`; hidden for CONVERTED and null status | | | |
| AC-FN-5 | Add Billing disabled state binds to card-added | Code review: TrialPlanCard | Disabled prop / className wired to the platform-reported card-added state | | | |
| AC-FN-6 | Subscribe Now and Manage billing call existing platform endpoints | Code review: TrialPlanCard / HostedPlanCard | Subscribe Now opens `PLATFORM_SUBSCRIBE_URL`; Manage billing fires `POST ${PLATFORM_API_URL}/api/billing/portal` with `Authorization: Bearer ${LICENSE_KEY}` and opens returned `url` | | | |
| AC-FN-7 | Cancel modal reason capture submits to platform | Code review: CancelTrialDialog | Form submission posts reason + optional textarea content to platform endpoint; failure surfaces a toast and keeps modal open. (No-card variant may stub the platform call — endpoint ships in platform `trial-cancellation` feature) | | | |
| AC-FN-8 | Export endpoint returns ZIP with correct headers | Interactive: `curl -I http://localhost:4000/api/admin/export` (logged in) | `Content-Type: application/zip` and `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="*.zip"` | | | |
| AC-FN-9 | Export ZIP includes data + media + manifest | Interactive: `curl -o /tmp/x.zip http://localhost:4000/api/admin/export && unzip -l /tmp/x.zip` | At minimum: `data/products.json`, `data/orders.json`, `data/users.json`, `data/siteSettings.json`, `media/` directory, `manifest.json` | | | |
| AC-FN-10 | Export endpoint requires admin auth | Interactive: `curl http://localhost:4000/api/admin/export` (no session) | 401 or 403; no ZIP body | | | |

## Test Coverage Acceptance Criteria

| AC | What | How | Pass | Agent | QC | Reviewer |
|----|------|-----|------|-------|----|----------|
| AC-TST-1 | `getTrialStatus()` returns parsed JSON on 200 | Test run: `npm run test:ci` | Mock `fetch` returns valid status JSON; assert function returns the same shape | | | |
| AC-TST-2 | `getTrialStatus()` returns null on 5xx / network error | Test run: `npm run test:ci` | Mock `fetch` returns 500; assert function returns `null` without throwing | | | |
| AC-TST-3 | `getTrialStatus()` returns null when env unset | Test run: `npm run test:ci` | Test with `HOSTED_TRIAL_ID` unset; assert null + no fetch call | | | |
| AC-TST-4 | `IS_HOSTED` reflects env presence | Test run: `npm run test:ci` | Two tests with env set/unset; assert constant value | | | |
| AC-TST-5 | Plan catalog filter selects correct plans by `IS_HOSTED` | Test run: `npm run test:ci` | Test renders / filters with each (IS_HOSTED, status) pair; asserts only expected plans pass the filter | | | |

## Regression Acceptance Criteria

| AC | What | How | Pass | Agent | QC | Reviewer |
|----|------|-----|------|-------|----|----------|
| AC-REG-1 | All existing tests pass | Test run: `npm run test:ci` | All test suites pass; no new failures introduced | | | |
| AC-REG-2 | Precheck passes clean | Test run: `npm run precheck` | 0 TypeScript errors, 0 ESLint errors | | | |
| AC-REG-3 | Self-hosted plans page pixel-identical to main (Setup A) | Screenshot diff: side-by-side current `main` vs branch at `/admin/support/plans` | No visual difference at desktop / tablet / mobile breakpoints | | | |
| AC-REG-4 | Self-hosted Data Privacy tab adds only Download card | Screenshot diff: `/admin/support/terms` Data Privacy tab between main and branch with Setup A | Only the Download Your Data card is new; rest of the tab unchanged |  |  |  |
| AC-REG-5 | Existing Priority Support flows still functional (Setup B) | Screenshot: `/admin/support` and `/admin/support/plans` with Setup B | Priority Support active card renders with usage bars + Manage; Submit Ticket flow still works |  | | |
