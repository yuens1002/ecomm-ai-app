# Coffee Roaster Outreach List

**Goal:** Find 10 real coffee roasters to DM with offer: "I'll set up your store free in exchange for feedback"

---

## Outreach Message Template

### Instagram/Twitter DM

```
Hey [Name]! 👋

I've been building an open-source e-commerce platform specifically for specialty coffee roasters, and I'm looking for feedback from real roasters.

Would you be interested in a free store setup in exchange for your honest feedback? No strings attached - it's MIT licensed so you'd own everything.

The platform has AI-powered recommendations (customers can ask "what's good for pour-over?"), built-in subscriptions, and a drag-and-drop menu builder.

Demo: https://ecomm-ai-app.vercel.app/

Either way, love what you're doing with [specific thing about their coffee]. Keep roasting great beans! ☕
```

### Email Version

Subject: Free e-commerce setup for [Roastery Name] - looking for feedback

Hi [Name],

I'm building an open-source e-commerce platform specifically for specialty coffee roasters, and I'm reaching out to a handful of roasters I admire for feedback.

My offer: I'll set up a complete online store for [Roastery Name] for free. In exchange, I'd love 30 minutes of your feedback on what works, what doesn't, and what features would actually help your business.

What makes it different from Shopify/WooCommerce:
- AI assistant that understands coffee (customers can ask "what's bright and fruity?")
- Subscriptions built-in (Stripe handles everything)
- Drag-and-drop menu organization
- No monthly fees (MIT open source, self-hosted)

Live demo: https://ecomm-ai-app.vercel.app/

No pressure either way. I just figured it's better to build something roasters actually want than guess from my desk.

Thanks for roasting great coffee!

[Your name]
```

### How to Find Them

## Research Tips

### Red Flags (Skip These)
- Already on Shopify Plus (too invested to switch)
- Multi-location chains (too complex for MVP)
- No social media presence (hard to reach, may not value tech)
- Recently redesigned website (not looking to change)

### Green Flags (Prioritize These)
- Complaints about current platform in posts
- Using basic Squarespace/Wix with limited features
- No subscription option but customers asking for it
- Manually managing orders via DMs/email
- Small team, wearing many hats

### Conversation Starters
- Comment genuinely on their posts before DMing
- Mention specific coffees you've tried (if true)
- Reference a recent post or achievement
- Keep it short - respect their time

## Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 0:** Initial outreach
**Day 3:** If no response, like/comment on recent post (stay visible)
**Day 7:** Brief follow-up: "Hey! Just bumping this in case it got buried. No worries if you're not interested - keep roasting great coffee!"
**Day 14:** Final follow-up or move on

## Notes

- Don't spam. Quality over quantity.
- Personalize every message. Generic = ignored.
- Actually try their coffee if possible (authentic connection).
- Be prepared to deliver on the free setup promise.
- Document feedback received for product improvements.
