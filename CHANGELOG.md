## 0.11.7 - 2025-11-18

- **Split Orders for Mixed Carts**: Implemented order splitting for mixed carts with architectural pivot based on Stripe's subscription model
  - **Order Structure**: Mixed carts now create separate orders:
    - One order for all one-time items
    - ONE order for ALL subscription items (architectural decision based on Stripe creating one subscription with multiple line items)
    - **Tradeoff**: Recurring orders must lookup PurchaseOption by name using fuzzy match - risk if product name changes significantly
    - Documented directly in Prisma schema for future maintainability
  - **Webhook Refactoring**: Complete overhaul of both subscription webhooks to handle multiple products:
    - `checkout.session.completed`: Loops through `subscription.items.data` to extract all products into arrays, creates single order with all subscription items
    - `invoice.payment_succeeded`: Handles both initial subscription and renewals with array support, loops through productNames to find PurchaseOptions for recurring orders
  - **Duplicate Subscription Prevention**: Updated checkout validation to check all products across productNames arrays (uses `flatMap` and `includes()` to detect duplicates)
  - **Order Cancellation**: Added admin endpoint `/api/admin/orders/[orderId]/cancel` for manually canceling orders
  - **UI Enhancements**:
    - Subscription tab now displays subscription ID without "sub\_" prefix for cleaner look
    - Lists all products in subscription with quantities (e.g., "Death Valley Espresso - 2lb Bag × 2")
    - Removed product description field for cleaner UI
    - Kept billing period display for subscription transparency
  - **Helper Scripts**: Created `scripts/cancel-active-subscriptions.ts` for bulk subscription cancellation during testing
- **Database Migrations**:
  - `20251118024917_add_subscription_id_to_order` - Added `stripeSubscriptionId` to Order model for linking orders to subscriptions
  - `20251118054840_change_subscription_to_arrays` - Changed Subscription from single values to arrays (productName → productNames[], etc.)
- **Testing Results**:
  - ✅ Mixed cart with 2 different subscription products (Death Valley 2lb + Guatemalan 12oz weekly)
  - ✅ Single subscription record created with both products in arrays
  - ✅ Single order created containing all subscription items
  - ✅ UI correctly displays all products with quantities
  - ✅ Checkout validation prevents duplicate subscriptions across all products
  - ✅ Both webhooks handle arrays correctly
  - ✅ TypeScript compilation passing (fixed 13 errors across 4 files)
- **Architecture Notes**: This feature represents a significant pivot from the initial design (separate order per subscription item) after discovering Stripe creates one subscription with multiple line items, not separate subscriptions per product. The array-based approach provides flexibility for multi-product subscriptions while maintaining data integrity and simplifying fulfillment workflows.

## 0.11.6 - 2025-11-17

- **Recurring Order Creation**: Automatic order creation for subscription renewals
  - Enhanced `invoice.payment_succeeded` webhook to differentiate between initial subscription payments and renewals using `billing_reason` field
  - Initial subscriptions (`billing_reason: "subscription_create"`): Update Subscription record in database

  - **ShipmentConfirmationEmail**: Shows "📦 Your Subscription Order Has Shipped!" with subscription cadence in preview and body text
  - All templates accept `isRecurringOrder?: boolean` and `deliverySchedule?: string` props for conditional rendering
- **Smart Email Strategy**: Optimized notification flow to reduce email fatigue
  - Recurring order creation: Only merchant receives notification, customer email skipped
  - Order shipment: Customer receives single email combining order confirmation + tracking + subscription context
  - Reduces customer emails from 2 to 1 per subscription renewal cycle
  - Logs clearly indicate: "⏭️ Skipping customer email - will send with tracking when order ships"
- **Comprehensive Testing Documentation**: Created `docs/testing-recurring-orders.md` (~300 lines)

## 0.11.5 - 2025-11-17

- **Webhook Event Refactor**: Hybrid approach for subscription creation using both `checkout.session.completed` and `invoice.payment_succeeded`
  - **Immediate payment methods (cards)**: Subscription created in `checkout.session.completed` when `payment_status === "paid"` and `subscription.status` is `"active"` or `"trialing"` - provides instant UX feedback
  - **Async payment methods (ACH, SEPA, etc.)**: Subscription created in `invoice.payment_succeeded` when payment confirms later - ensures data integrity
  - Renewal payments: Handled by `invoice.payment_succeeded` for all billing cycles
  - Status changes: Handled by `customer.subscription.updated` event
  - Prevents orphaned subscription records from failed or incomplete payments
  - **Bug Fix**: Exclude CANCELED subscriptions from duplicate check to allow re-subscription to previously canceled products
  - **Bug Fix**: Extract billing period from `subscription.items` instead of top-level subscription object
  - **Bug Fix**: Check both `cancel_at_period_end` and `cancel_at` fields for scheduled cancellations (Stripe uses `cancel_at` for portal cancellations)
  - Safety checks: Verify `payment_status === "paid"` and valid subscription status before creating records
  - **Known Limitation**: Mixed orders (one-time + subscription items) create single order; canceling order doesn't cancel subscription. See backlog for planned split-order implementation.
- **Subscription Schema Refactor**: Removed `variantName` field from Subscription model since `productName` already contains the full product+variant combination (e.g., "Death Valley Espresso - 12oz Bag")
  - Simplified webhook handler to only use `productName` from Stripe
  - Updated all UI components (AccountPageClient, SubscriptionsTab) to display `productName` only
  - Database migration: `20251117061523_remove_variant_name_from_subscription`

  - Database migration: `20251117031833_remove_delivery_schedule_from_purchase_option`
  - Updated seed data to use structured interval fields consistently
- **Cart Store Refactor**: Replaced deprecated `deliverySchedule` with `billingInterval` and `billingIntervalCount` fields
  - Added `formatBillingInterval()` utility for consistent schedule display across app
  - Cart items now show subscription cadence labels (e.g., "Subscription - Every week")
- **Enhanced Subscription UX**:
  - Hide "Subscribe & Save" option when variant already has subscription in cart
  - Auto-switch to one-time purchase after adding subscription to cart
  - Dynamic delivery schedule dropdown generated from available subscription options
  - Checkout requires authentication for subscription purchases with helpful redirect notice
  - Improved duplicate subscription error messages with proper singular/plural grammar and bullet-point lists
- **Order Confirmation Emails**: Enhanced to distinguish between one-time and subscription items
  - Display purchase type inline with product name (e.g., "• One-time" or "• Subscription - Every week")
  - Shows delivery schedule for subscription items using `formatBillingInterval()` utility
  - Applied to both customer and merchant order notification emails
- **Toast Notification System**: Replaced browser alerts with styled toast notifications
  - Custom inverted theme colors (`bg-foreground`, `text-background`)
