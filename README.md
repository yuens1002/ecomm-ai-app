## Why Artisan Roast?

Most e-commerce platforms treat coffee like any other product. But your customers don't just want "a bag of coffee" - they want *their* coffee. Light and fruity? Dark and chocolatey? Something new to try?

**Artisan Roast understands coffee.**

- **AI that speaks coffee** - "I like bright, citrusy flavors" → instant recommendations
- **Subscriptions that just work** - Set it and forget it, with easy customer self-service
- **Menu Builder** - Organize your catalog the way *you* think about it (Origins → Ethiopian → Yirgacheffe)
- **Self-host for free** - MIT licensed, your data stays yours

---

## See It In Action

| For Your Customers | For You |
|---|---|
| Browse by origin, roast, or tasting notes | Beautiful admin dashboard |
| AI chat: "What's similar to Ethiopian Yirgacheffe?" | Drag-and-drop menu organization |
| One-click subscriptions | Order management & analytics |
| Stripe checkout (cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay) | Pages CMS with AI content generation |
