# Artisan Roast — Install Verification

> **Reference stack:** Neon (database) + Vercel (deployment).
> Any hosted PostgreSQL accepting standard Prisma connection strings is supported,
> but results are only guaranteed on the reference stack.
>
> Verified nightly against a fresh install: empty Neon database + dedicated QA Vercel deployment.
> Push to `main` triggers DB reset + redeployment (`install-test.yml`); browser verification
> runs the following morning at 6am UTC (`qa-nightly.yml`) via Claude Agent SDK + Playwright.
> Known values are injected from CI secrets — never hardcoded in this file.
